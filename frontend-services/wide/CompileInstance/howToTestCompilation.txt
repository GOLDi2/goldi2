prerequisites: {
    Language has to be implemented: {
        Subfolder in the languages folder, name has to be name of the language (e.g. the folder for arduino is called "arduino")
        inside of this folder there HAS to be a Languagemodule.js file, that exports the following 3 functions: {
            compile
            getVersion
            isAvailableOnHost
        }
        for more info on the Languagemodule.js file, see the sample/template under ./Languages/template/Languagemodule.js
        It is recommended to use the template if you want to add a new language
    }
}

testing: {
    - for testing, you will need a test request. Since the Loadbalancer is not ready yet, you'll have to do it manually.
    - You can copy the _testCompileRequest.js in this folder and just edit the data object starting on line 6 of the file 
    - start the server.js ("node server.js" in the terminal, working directory has to be the CompileInstance folder)
    - start your test request in another terminal and hope for the best (:
