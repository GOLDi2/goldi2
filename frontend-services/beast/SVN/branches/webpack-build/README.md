# BEAST - Blockdiagram Editor and Simulation Tool

## Fork of simcir.js

BEAST was forked from simcir.js on 25-04-2017
at commit b388cc287c63eb4e2bdf41e1e22b5b5bb9973381 .
The original repositiory is available under:
https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/simcirjs
The old README.txt is included as README_SIMCIR.txt

Most of the old simcir codebase will be located in 
`js/simcir` and refactored as needed.

## Development Setup

1. install nodejs
2. run npm install in the project root, this will
fetch the dependencies for webpack and the required filters
